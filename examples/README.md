- [SMA Crossover (SPY)](example_sma.ipynb)
- [Mean Reversion (QQQ)](example_mean_reversion.ipynb)

Notes:
- Notebooks fetch or load data and render plots. In CI and headless environments, matplotlib uses the `Agg` backend.
- Large images are not stored in the repo history. Outputs from runs are saved under `runs/` and are gitignored to keep the repository lightweight.
- To reproduce screenshots, execute the notebooks or run the CLI and open images in the corresponding `runs/<timestamp>/` folder.
